# Parry-Knight
## Introduction
Hello! This is my small game, Parry Knight. I once played a top-down 2D shooter, one of the Vampire Survivor clones... 
I thought to myself. These types of games are always focused on the damage output you accumulate over time.
They also stress the stacking of health and defenses. But they don't give you the possibility to reflect the damage that targets you.
Also, the ability to take out an enemy using the power of their weapon is always fun in my opinion.
So, I took it upon myself to spend some days working on this game, and here is what I came out with.
## Mechanics
In this section. I'll talk about the mechanics of the game. Let's start with :
### The parry mechanic
This mechanic is the base behavior that's demanded from the player to survive. 
How is it performed you ask?
By pressing the **Shift key** and pointing the cursor toward the direction you wish the projectile to be launched in.

But it's not as simple as that!

#### Perfect Timing!

In order to reflect the projectile you need perfect timing. You need to press the **Shift** button just as the projectile is about to hit your character.
The perfect timing window is not fixed as you level up you'll be able to increase it.

#### Leveling up

In this game, you gain experience by reflecting the projectiles away from you. When you collect enough to level up, you'll get the possibility to increase your stats.

#### Juggling projectiles

As I mentioned before, the parry mechanic is a little complex. You can parry a projectile multiple times. 
Each time you increase its damage and that is noticed through a change in the color of its trail.

Some of you might ask why are the colors listed on the projectile and not on the shield itself.
Well, I have different projectile types, I have **rock** and **arrow** thrown by respectively by an **archer** and a **rock-thrower** enemy.
